```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AdaMVL.git
cd AdaMVL
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the datasets in `data/` are correctly structured, with the benchmark and evaluation datasets properly organized.
2. **Method Implementation**: The `function/` directory includes all necessary implementations for running multi-view learning models.
3. **Evaluation and Analysis**: Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebook/` directory to conduct evaluation workflows, similarity calculations, and representation extraction.
4. **Utilities**: The `utils/` directory contains helper scripts for metrics and processing, which are used in the notebooks and main methods.

### Running the Notebooks
Open the notebooks in `notebook/` to explore the evaluation process and follow along with representation calculations, similarity extraction, and other analyses:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
